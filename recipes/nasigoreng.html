    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 leek, chopped</li>
        <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li> 
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>½ pound peeled and deveined prawns</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sweet soy sauce (Indonesian kecap manis)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread onto a baking sheet, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour eggs into the hot skillet and cook until the edges begin to set. Lift the edges to allow any uncooked egg to flow onto the hot pan, about 1 minute. Flip omelet in one piece and cook until fully set, about 30 seconds. Transfer omelet to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch strips. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Stir in onion, leek, chile peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, prawns, coriander, and cumin; mix well. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in cold rice, sweet soy sauce, and omelet strips; cook until shrimp are bright pink and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>This is an amazing meal with a lot of nutrients. For vegans, you can swap the eggs with silken tofu, and the chicken and prawns can be replaced with mushrooms</p>
